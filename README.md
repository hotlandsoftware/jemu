# What the hell is it?
GEMU is a generic emulator designed to emulate as many machines, hardware, and peripherals as possible - while maintaining the simple UI of Virtual PC 2007 and flexibility, advanced featureset, speed, and ease of use of QEMU. 

GEMU is still in an alpha state. It will likely never be "complete" as there will always be more machines and hardware for it to emulate. Currently the absolute latest (for my end) is set to 1985 (exceptions made for clone consoles), and will be increased as more machines are completed/added.

# Build command
```
make
make GTK=1 # for GTK support
```
# Targets

# Why?
To put it bluntly, I'm very curious to see how far AI agents have come, and I'm curious to see *how* many different machines we can make AI emulate with little reference. (And also because I wanted something like MAME with the power of QEMU that could run off a VNC server.)
